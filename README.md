# Functional Data Structures

A collection of clean, functional implementations of common data structures. Starting with Haskell versions. Will eventually have Haskell, Ocaml, and Scheme variants of all.

Each file is a collection of implementations of a family of data structures. So, with Haskell for example, `heaps.hs`, `queues.hs`, etc.

Update: I will be doing F# versions as well due to demand.
