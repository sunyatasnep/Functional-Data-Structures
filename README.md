# Functional Data Structures

A collection of clean, functional implementations of common data structures. Starting with Haskell versions. Will eventually have Haskell, Ocaml, and Scheme variants of all.

Each file is a collection of implementations of a family of data structures. So, with Haskell for example, `heaps.hs`, `queues.hs`, etc.

Currently I am not planning on F# variants as F# is sufficiently similar to Ocaml that translation should be straightforward. I will consider doing them if there is sufficient interest however.
